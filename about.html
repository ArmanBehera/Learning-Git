        <h2 class="top">How It All Started</h2>
        <hr>
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>Hey there! I am Arman, a high school student with a deep passion for coding and software development. Currently residing in Dhenkanal, a small town in the state of Odisha, India, I discovered my love for coding when my brother introduced me to a C course on Udemy by Tim Bulchaka and Jason Fedin back in the 6th standard.</p>

            <p>At that time, concepts like pointers and recursion seemed overwhelming, but that course ignited a curiosity in me to explore the vast world of computer science. As I delved further, I experimented with various fields, including Game Development in Unreal Engine. However, I soon realized that my true interest lay in software development, although I want to pursue artificial intelligence or quantum computing in the future.</p>

            <p>Java became a turning point in my coding journey. Its object-oriented paradigm and streamlined memory management captivated me, and I found myself diving deeper into the language. Alongside Java, I began my exploration of algorithms and data structures, sharpening my problem-solving skills through platforms like HackerRank, HackerEarth, and LeetCode.</p>

            <p>Till now, I have taken many courses and used many books but the most notable ones are <em><b>Java: A Complete Reference</b></em> By Herbert Schildt and <em><b>CS50</b></em> by Harvard University. I have learnt a lot from these resources and I can't describe enough how helpful these have been to me.</p>

            <p>Throughout my coding endeavors, I embarked on numerous projects that allowed me to apply my knowledge practically. Some notable ones are showcased on my <a href="projects.html">My Projects</a> page. These projects mean a huge deal to me and also taught me what it is to be like an actual software developer. It also made me familiar with popular websites such as stack overflow, geeksforgeeks and official documentation among others.</p>

            <p>Coding has been an incredible journey of growth, and I am excited to continue honing my skills and contributing to the world of technology.</p>

        <h2 class="after-top">Hobbies</h2>
        <hr>
        <div class="paragrph">
            <p>When I'm not immersed in the world of coding and software development, I love exploring various hobbies that bring joy and balance to my life.</p>
            <p>From outdoor adventures to artistic pursuits, here are some of the hobbies that I'm passionate about: Reading, Bicycling and Music.</p>

            <h5 class="top">Reading</h5>
            <hr>
            <p>Books have been my constant companion since childhood. Reading novels and scientific fiction has been and always will be my favorite hobby. Books have consistently provided me with endless entertainmemt, starting from reading the fun and creative world of Geronimo Stilton books during my childhood, to the captivating and intense battles within the Harry Potter Universe. Some of my favorite authors are J.K. Rowling (obviously), J.R.R. Tolkein and Suzanne Collins.</p>
            <p>I am particularly drawn towards books because they provide more detailed and vivid scenes than movies ever can, and that makes all the difference. The power of written words to transport us to incredible worlds, introduce us to captivating characters, and weave intricate plots is simply enchanting. They also help me escape reality when I am having a particularly bad day. Coding gives me most of those &#128578 (especially during debugging).</p>

            <h5 class="after-top">Bicycling</h5>
            <hr>
            <p>I have been bicycling since I can remember. From little strolls in my neighbourhood, to going on long trips with friends, it has always been a fun experience. One of the most memorable adventures was the longest trip I ever took, which led me to Kapilash Deer Park, approximately 12 miles away from my home. This zoo, located near a renowned temple, offered a unique and exciting journey. The route to the temple presented some challenging terrain, adding an extra element of fun and accomplishment to the trip. Aside from that memorable journey, I have embarked on various other trips that have further deepened my love for bicycling.</p>

            <h5 class="after-top">Music</h5>
            <hr>
            <p>Music has always been an integral part of my life, and it is one of my most cherished hobbies. Whether I'm seeking solace, celebrating moments of joy, or finding inspiration, music is my faithful companion on this journey.</p>
            <p>My love for music knows no bounds, and I enjoy exploring various genres and discovering new artists. Each song has a unique story to tell, and I find myself captivated by the emotions and messages conveyed through melodies and lyrics.</p>
